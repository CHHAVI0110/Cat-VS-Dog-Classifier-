FINE-TUNED-DOG-CAT-MODEL 
A deep learning project that classifies images as either a dog or a cat using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and fine-tuned transfer learning (VGG16). Built with TensorFlow and Keras.

Overview:
This project aims to solve a binary image classification problem: distinguishing between dogs and cats using image data. The model is trained using both a custom CNN and a pre-trained VGG16 model with fine-tuning.

Technologies & Libraries:
- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- VGG16 (pre-trained on ImageNet)

Features:
- Custom CNN and VGG16-based model
- Fine-tuning for improved accuracy
- Save & load trained model
- Predict custom images
